**Overview**

This project aims to analyze and understand chronic diseases, specifically Type 1 Diabetes and Asthma, among children, teenagers, and adolescents in the United States. It leverages extensive healthcare data to gain insights into the prevalence and demographic distribution of these diseases.

**Objectives**
- To provide a comprehensive analysis of chronic diseases in youth populations.
- To identify demographic factors that correlate with the incidence of Type 1 Diabetes and Asthma.
- To aid healthcare professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and policymakers in  understanding and having better solutions in marketing for these diagnoses.

**Data Source**
The project utilizes the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) dataset from 2019, encompassing over 4 million rows of data.

**Methodology**
- Data Processing: Employing Python for data cleaning and preparation, including updating diagnoses based on healthcare codes and merging datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Modeling: The processed data is prepared for EDA and further modeling.
- Statistical Analysis: Uses clustering techniques for detailed analysis and a chi-square test to understand the relationships between diagnoses and various demographic factors like income, region, gender, age groups, and racial groups.
- Visualization: Data visualizations are crafted using Power BI, providing clear and insightful representations of our findings.

**Key Technologies**
- Python: Primary language for data processing and analysis.
- Power BI: Used for creating interactive and informative visualizations.
